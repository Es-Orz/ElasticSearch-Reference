![Tip](images/icons/tip.png)

The `ignore_above` setting is allowed to have different settings for fields of the same name in the same index. Its value can be updated on existing fields using the [PUT mapping API](indices-put-mapping.html).

This option is also useful for protecting against Luceneâ€™s term byte-length limit of `32766`.

![Note](images/icons/note.png)

The value for `ignore_above` is the _character count_ , but Lucene counts bytes. If you use UTF-8 text with many non-ASCII characters, you may want to set the limit to `32766 / 3 = 10922` since UTF-8 characters may occupy at most 3 bytes.
