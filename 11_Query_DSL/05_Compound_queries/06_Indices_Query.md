## Indices Query

![Warning](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/images/icons/warning.png)

### Deprecated in 5.0.0. 

Search on the \__index_ field instead 

The `indices` query is useful in cases where a search is executed across multiple indices. It allows to specify a list of index names and an inner query that is only executed for indices matching names on that list. For other indices that are searched, but that donâ€™t match entries on the list, the alternative `no_match_query` is executed.
    
    
    GET /_search
    {
        "query": {
            "indices" : {
                "indices" : ["index1", "index2"],
                "query" : { "term" : { "tag" : "wow" } },
                "no_match_query" : { "term" : { "tag" : "kow" } }
            }
        }
    }

You can use the `index` field to provide a single index.

`no_match_query` can also have "string" value of `none` (to match no documents), and `all` (to match all). Defaults to `all`.

`query` is mandatory, as well as `indices` (or `index`).
