## Token Filters

Token filters accept a stream of tokens from a [tokenizer](analysis-tokenizers.html) and can modify tokens (eg lowercasing), delete tokens (eg remove stopwords) or add tokens (eg synonyms).

Elasticsearch has a number of built in token filters which can be used to build [custom analyzers](analysis-custom-analyzer.html).
