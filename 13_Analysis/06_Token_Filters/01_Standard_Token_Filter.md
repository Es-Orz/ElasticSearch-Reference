## Standard Token Filter

A token filter of type `standard` that normalizes tokens extracted with the [Standard Tokenizer](analysis-standard-tokenizer.html).

![Tip](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/images/icons/tip.png)

The `standard` token filter currently does nothing. It remains as a placeholder in case some filtering function needs to be added in a future version.
