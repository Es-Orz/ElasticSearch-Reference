## Plugins

### Plugins

Plugins are a way to enhance the basic elasticsearch functionality in a custom manner. They range from adding custom mapping types, custom analyzers (in a more built in fashion), native scripts, custom discovery and more.

See the [Plugins documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/plugins/5.4/index.html) for more.
