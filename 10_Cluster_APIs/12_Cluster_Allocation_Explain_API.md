## Cluster Allocation Explain API

The purpose of the cluster allocation explain API is to provide explanations for shard allocations in the cluster. For unassigned shards, the explain API provides an explanation for why the shard is unassigned. For assigned shards, the explain API provides an explanation for why the shard is remaining on its current node and has not moved or rebalanced to another node. This API can be very useful when attempting to diagnose why a shard is unassigned or why a shard continues to remain on its current node when you might expect otherwise.

### Explain API Request

To explain the allocation of a shard, first an index should exist:
    
    
    PUT /myindex

And then the allocation for shards of that index can be explained:
    
    
    GET /_cluster/allocation/explain
    {
      "index": "myindex",
      "shard": 0,
      "primary": true
    }

Specify the `index` and `shard` id of the shard you would like an explanation for, as well as the `primary` flag to indicate whether to explain the primary shard for the given shard id or one of its replica shards. These three request parameters are required.

You may also specify an optional `current_node` request parameter to only explain a shard that is currently located on `current_node`. The `current_node` can be specified as either the node id or node name.
    
    
    GET /_cluster/allocation/explain
    {
      "index": "myindex",
      "shard": 0,
      "primary": false,
      "current_node": "nodeA"                         ![](images/icons/callouts/1.png)
    }

You can also have Elasticsearch explain the allocation of the first unassigned shard that it finds by sending an empty body for the request:
    
    
    GET /_cluster/allocation/explain

An explanation as to why the decider returned a `no` decision, with a helpful hint pointing to the setting that led to the decision   
  
You can return information gathered by the cluster info service about disk usage and shard sizes by setting the `include_disk_info` parameter to `true`:
    
    
    GET /_cluster/allocation/explain?include_disk_info=true

Additionally, if you would like to include all decisions that were factored into the final decision, the `include_yes_decisions` parameter will return all decisions for each node:
    
    
    GET /_cluster/allocation/explain?include_yes_decisions=true

The default value for `include_yes_decisions` is `false`, which will only include the `no` decisions in the response. This is generally what you would want, as the `no` decisions indicate why a shard is unassigned or cannot be moved, and including all decisions include the `yes` ones adds a lot of verbosity to the APIâ€™s response output.
