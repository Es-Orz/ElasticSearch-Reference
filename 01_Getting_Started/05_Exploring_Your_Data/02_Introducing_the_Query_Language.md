## Introducing the Query Language

Elasticsearch provides a JSON-style domain-specific language that you can use to execute queries. This is referred to as the [Query DSL](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.4/query-dsl.html). The query language is quite comprehensive and can be intimidating at first glance but the best way to actually learn it is to start with a few basic examples.

Going back to our last example, we executed this query:
    
    
    GET /bank/_search
    {
      "query": { "match_all": {} }
    }

Dissecting the above, the `query` part tells us what our query definition is and the `match_all` part is simply the type of query that we want to run. The `match_all` query is simply a search for all documents in the specified index.

In addition to the `query` parameter, we also can pass other parameters to influence the search results. In the example in the div above we passed in `sort`, here we pass in `size`:
    
    
    GET /bank/_search
    {
      "query": { "match_all": {} },
      "size": 1
    }

Note that if `size` is not specified, it defaults to 10.

This example does a `match_all` and returns documents 11 through 20:
    
    
    GET /bank/_search
    {
      "query": { "match_all": {} },
      "from": 10,
      "size": 10
    }

The `from` parameter (0-based) specifies which document index to start from and the `size` parameter specifies how many documents to return starting at the from parameter. This feature is useful when implementing paging of search results. Note that if `from` is not specified, it defaults to 0.

This example does a `match_all` and sorts the results by account balance in descending order and returns the top 10 (default size) documents.
    
    
    GET /bank/_search
    {
      "query": { "match_all": {} },
      "sort": { "balance": { "order": "desc" } }
    }
