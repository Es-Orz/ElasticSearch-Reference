## Multiple Indices

Most APIs that refer to an `index` parameter support execution across multiple indices, using simple `test1,test2,test3` notation (or `_all` for all indices). It also support wildcards, for example: `test*` or `*test` or `te*t` or `*test*`, and the ability to "add" (`+`) and "remove" (`-`), for example: `+test*,-test3`.

All multi indices API support the following url query string parameters:

`ignore_unavailable`
     Controls whether to ignore if any specified indices are unavailable, this includes indices that donâ€™t exist or closed indices. Either `true` or `false` can be specified. 
`allow_no_indices`
     Controls whether to fail if a wildcard indices expressions results into no concrete indices. Either `true` or `false` can be specified. For example if the wildcard expression `foo*` is specified and no indices are available that start with `foo` then depending on this setting the request will fail. This setting is also applicable when `_all`, `*` or no index has been specified. This settings also applies for aliases, in case an alias points to a closed index. 
`expand_wildcards`
    

Controls to what kind of concrete indices wildcard indices expression expand to. If `open` is specified then the wildcard expression is expanded to only open indices and if `closed` is specified then the wildcard expression is expanded only to closed indices. Also both values (`open,closed`) can be specified to expand to all indices. 

If `none` is specified then wildcard expansion will be disabled and if `all` is specified, wildcard expressions will expand to all indices (this is equivalent to specifying `open,closed`).

The defaults settings for the above parameters depend on the api being used.

Single index APIs such as the [Document APIs](docs.html "Document APIs") and the [single-index `alias` APIs](indices-aliases.html "Index Aliases") do not support multiple indices.
