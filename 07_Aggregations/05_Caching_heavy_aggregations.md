## Caching heavy aggregations

Frequently used aggregations (e.g. for display on the home page of a website) can be cached for faster responses. These cached results are the same results that would be returned by an uncached aggregation — you will never get stale results.

See [Shard request cache](shard-request-cache.html) for more details.
