## Matrix Aggregations

![Warning](images/icons/warning.png)

This functionality is experimental and may be changed or removed completely in a future release. Elastic will take a best effort approach to fix any issues, but experimental features are not subject to the support SLA of official GA features.

The aggregations in this family operate on multiple fields and produce a matrix result based on the values extracted from the requested document fields. Unlike metric and bucket aggregations, this aggregation family does not yet support scripting.
