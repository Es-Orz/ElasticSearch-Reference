## Index Shard Allocation

This module provides per-index settings to control the allocation of shards to nodes:

  * [Shard allocation filtering](shard-allocation-filtering.html): Controlling which shards are allocated to which nodes. 
  * [Delayed allocation](delayed-allocation.html): Delaying allocation of unassigned shards caused by a node leaving. 
  * [Total shards per node](allocation-total-shards.html): A hard limit on the number of shards from the same index per node.
